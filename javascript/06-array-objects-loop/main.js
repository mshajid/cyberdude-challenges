// I need to create a book lists in an Array of Objects.
// Each object should contain Book Name / Book Author / Pages / Genre
// Logic: I wanted to find How many hours would go to complete each book.
// ! 238 Words Per Minute (Silent Reader)
// ! 183 Words Per Minute (Loud Reader)
// ! Formula -> 2500 Words / 238 Words Per Minute = 10.50 (It Will take approximately ~10 Minutes) (Avergae Silent Reader);
// ! Formula -> 2500 Words / 183 Words Per Minute = 13.66 (It Will take appriximately ~13 Minutes) (Average Loud Reader);
